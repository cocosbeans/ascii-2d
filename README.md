# ascii-2d
This repo contains the [Matrix](https://gist.github.com/cocosbeans/f790a1520490836871361e4dbf6b1ff5) class as well as [ways to manipulate it geometrically](/src/draw.js). Therefore, these functions serve as a toolset of drawing tools to set up any 2D scene via ASCII characters with a matrix.
